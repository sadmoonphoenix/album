The album starts off with an "Intro", a song that I wish was an instrumental. The voice clips just stops me from enjoying the absolutely beautiful string track. Track 2, "All Girls Are The Same" is decent at best. It's not that good, but "Lucid Dreams" is a beautiful track with beautiful and deep lyrics from Jarad. "Lean Wit Me" starts with an absolutely chilling guitar riff, that continues throught the majority song.  This song is absolutely better than "Lucid Dreams" sonically, and lyrically too. This song definitely should've been more popular, but whatever. Jarad's vocals on this track are just....damn. Fading out the end of the song is a bit cheap though, especially in a hip hop track. "Wasted" is okay. Better than Track 1, but far from the best track on the album. "I'm Still" has an amazing strummed guitar backing, and sounds really good. The lyrics are a bit repetitive, but good nonetheless, especially the verses. The backing is definitely the highlight of this song for me. Again, Juice WRLD's vocals are great here. "Betrayal (Skit)" is interesting but ends up being an annoying interruption to the actual music on the album. The lyrics on "Candles" are great, and Juice's vocals are good. I wish there was a bit more depth to the actual track, but the way this song is mixed, it actually kind of works. One of the better songs on the album for sure. Highlight: I love the break down at 1:49. "Scared of Love" is a track I completely forgot about. I love it. A lot. The lyrics really hit, and Jarad's vocals sound fucking angelic here. My only complaint here is that obnoxious producer tag at the beginning. I also wish it didn't fade out. "Used To" is my second favorite song on the album. The guitar backing of course gains it extra points for, the lyrics really resonate with me personally, Juice's vocals and lyrics here are amazing. Top tier song, for sure. Annoyingly, it FUCKING FADES OUT AGAIN! "Karma (Skit)" is the same instrumental as "Intro" as far as I can tell. Again, a semi-annoying interruption. "Hurt Me" is great. Juice WRLD definitely got into a great flow with this song, and his lyrics are really heavy hitting here. The track itself is good, too. It still fades out. Annoying. "Black & White" has a good guitar track, and the vocals are good. Not my favorite song, but it's good. "Long Gone" is good. His vocals are good. Amazing even, but the track is a bit generic sounding. "End of the Road" has a great guitar and piano backing, amazing vocals, amazing lyrics, and amazing sonically. This is my favorite song on the album and a great closer. "I'll Be Fine" is good, not my favorite, but it's an okay closer to the album. I wish "End of the Road" closed up the album instead, but whatever, I'm pretty sure I'm the only one who cares about the order of albums in 2023. 
All being said, this album is a solid 9.4/10. Subject to adjustment, of course, but this'll probably stay here.
