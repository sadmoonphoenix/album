Morbid Stuff is PUP's 3rd album. And wow. Every song on this record is catchy as fuck, from the opening song simply titled Morbid Stuff, to Scorpion Hill, all through the end. The song writting here is fucking incredible, and improves further upon their sophomore album. All the songs have their own unique personality, it doesn't feel repetitive, and the music video for Kids actually slaps. I'm really impressed with that they've done here, and that's why I'm awarding Morbid Stuff my first 10/10, due to how many bangers and very little flaws there are here. 

<h3>Rating: 10/10</h3>
<hr />
I couldn't pick just one song so I ranked them:
<ol>
<li>Bare Hands</li>
<li>Scorpion Hill</li>
<li>Sibling Rivalry</li>
<li>Closure</li>
<li>Kids</li>
<li>See You At Your Funeral</li>
<li>City</li>
<li>Morbid Stuff</li>
<li>Free at Last</li>
<li>Bloody Mary, Kate and Ashley</li>
<li>Full Blown Meltdown</li>
</ol>
  
God some of that ordering in the middle was so tough, im still not 100% solid there but I'm just leaving it there. It's especially so difficult because even Full Blown Meltdown is easily a 7.9/10, and it just gets so much better from there.
