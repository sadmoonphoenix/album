Woah. I always forget how good this album is. It's amazing. Every single song is totally different and unique, yet they fit together perfectly. I thought Charlie Black and Timmy Bowers having a transition would make them blend too much, but the songs are definitely very different, if not the latter being a bit boring. Ordering these songs is incredibly difficult because they're definitely all B tier and up. The album generally alternates between a song by Bren and a song by Jake. If you couldn't already tell, I definitely prefer Jakes writing style. "Going to Bed Now", "Apartment" and "Notes" are generally upbeat songs that are really fun to listen to, while "Pothole" especially is one of these sit down and cry songs. Bren's songs are definitely generally more energetic, and I find sometimes he had trouble finding a balance, but for the most part his tracks are okay too. "Your Graduation" is an amazing track, and while bringing the drummer is certainly an odd choice, it works really well.  

Even with all the tonal differences between the songs, there's not much whiplash between the tracks, at least when listening to them in the intended order, and the songs are very much distinct in their style and writing/musical motifs. 

<h3>I may come back and change the rating later, but I'm going to give this one a 8/10 as a baseline for now.</h3>
